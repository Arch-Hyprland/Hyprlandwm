## Installation

The installation should work on all Arch Linux and Fedora based distributions. [You can find more information here](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles/wiki).

I recommend to install a base Hyprland system before installing the ML4W Hyprland Dotfiles. Then you have a stable starting point and can test Hyprland on your system beforehand. Hyprland is complex, under ongoing development, and requires additional components.

You can find the Hyprland Installation instructions here: https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Installation/

> IMPORTANT: Please make sure that all packages on your system are updated before running the installation script.

> PLEASE NOTE: Every Linux distribution, setup, and personal configuration can be different. Therefore, I cannot guarantee that the ML4W Dotfiles will work everywhere. You install at your own risk.
