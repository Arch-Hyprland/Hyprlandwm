## Installation

The installation should work on all Arch Linux based distributions. [You can find more information here](https://gitlab.com/stephan-raabe/dotfiles/-/wikis/home).

The easiest way is to use the setup.sh script. The script will download all files from GitLab and start the installation automatically.

Just copy/enter the following command into your terminal.

```
bash <(curl -s https://gitlab.com/stephan-raabe/dotfiles/-/raw/main/setup.sh)
```

> PLEASE NOTE: Every Linux distribution, setup and personal configuration can be different. Therefore, I cannot guarantee that the ML4W Dotfiles will work everywhere. Installation at your own risk.
