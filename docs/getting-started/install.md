# Installation

::: warning BEFORE YOU START
Please back up your existing `~/.config` folder with your dotfiles before starting the scripts for initial installation.
:::

The Dotfiles Installer will create a backup from configurations of your `.config` folder that will be overwritten from the installation procedure and previous ML4W Dotfiles installations.

If possible, please create a snapshot of your current system if snapper or Timeshift is installed and available.

## Recommendation

I recommend to install a base Hyprland system before installing the ML4W Hyprland Dotfiles. Then you have a stable starting point and can test Hyprland on your system before. Hyprland is complex, under ongoing development and requires additional components. 

On Arch Linux you can also install the Hyprland Desktop Profile first.

You can find the Hyprland Installation instructions on [hyprland wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Installation/)

The script will ask for an installation folder. Please enter a folder name without spaces. The script will create the folder for you and continue with the installation.
