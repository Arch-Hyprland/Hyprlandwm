## Installation with the Dotfiles Installer

::: warning BEFORE YOU START
Please back up your existing `~/.config` folder with your dotfiles before starting the scripts for initial installation.
:::

You can install the ML4W Dotfiles for Hyprland on any distribution by using the Dotfiles Installer from Flathub. Click on the badge below to install the app:

::: warning BEFORE YOU START
The Dotfiles Installer will create a backup from configurations of your `.config` folder that will be overwritten from the installation procedure and previous ML4W Dotfiles installations.

If possible, please create a snapshot of your current system if snapper or Timeshift is installed and available.
:::

Copy the following url into the Dotfiles Installer.

#### Stable Release

```sh
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles/main/hyprland-dotfiles-stable.dotinst
```
#### Rolling Release

```sh
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles/main/hyprland-dotfiles.dotinst
```

Setup scripts to install the required dependencies are included for Arch, Fedora and openSuse Tumbleweed. 

The installation of dependencies can take between 5 to 15 minutes depending on your internet connection and system performance.

::: info UNSUPPORTED DISTROS
For other distros, please install <a href="/dotfiles/getting-started/dependencies">the dependencies</a> first. Then install the Dotfiles by skipping the setup script.
:::

The Dotfiles will be installed into the folder `~/.mydotfiles` with symbolic links into `~/.config`.

::: info RECOMMENDATION
I recommend to install a base Hyprland system before installing the ML4W Hyprland Dotfiles. Then you have a stable starting point and can test Hyprland on your system before. Hyprland is complex, under ongoing development and requires additional components. 

On Arch Linux you can also install the Hyprland Desktop Profile first.

You can find the Hyprland Installation instructions on [hyprland wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Installation/)

### For Minimal Arch Linux installations

Install the following dependencies on a minimal Arch Linux installation

sudo pacman -S hyprland vim kitty firefox flatpak

```
Reboot and then start Hyprland with 

```sh [<i class="devicon-archlinux-plain"></i> Arch]
Hyprland

```
Open Firefox, open the Dotfiles Installer Homepage and follow the installation instructions.

::: warning AUR not supported anymore

## Installation with GNU stow

The installation without the Dotfiles Installer is possible but not recommended (especially not for beginners). 

> [!NOTE]
> Please create a backup from your current configuration. This guide is under developement

The manual installation requires stow. Please install it on your system e.g., on Arch with

```sh 
sudo pacman -S stow
```

Please follow the following steps:

```sh 
mkdir -p ~/Projects # Create a projects folder 
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles # Rolling Release
cd ~/Projects/dotfiles/setup # cd into the setup folder
./setup.sh # Run the setup script to install the dependencies
```
Create symlinks into your home folder

```sh 
cd ~/Projects/dotfiles
stow dotfiles
```

Restart your system.
