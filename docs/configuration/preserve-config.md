# Preserve your Customization

> [!NOTE]
> The Dotfiles Installer will install the dotfiles in .mydotfiles as default. You can customize the folder in Preferences.

## Protect folders in `.config` with the Dotfiles Installer

When you update your current ML4W dotfiles to a new version with the Dotfiles Installer, you can protect configuration folders or files in the `.config` folder with your adaptations. The Dotfiles Installer will store your selection for upcoming updates.
